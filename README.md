# Customer Churn Analysis Project

This project focuses on end-to-end data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Customer Churn dataset. The goal of this project is to identify key factors influencing customer churn and prepare the data for further analysis or model building.

---

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw customer churn data  
- Identify missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent entries  
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualize churn patterns and trends  
- Generate clear insights and recommendations for business action  

---

## 📊 Tasks Performed

### ✔️ Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values  
- Removed duplicate records  
- Standardized data types  
- Converted Yes/No values into 0/1 for easier analysis  
- Checked skewness, outliers, and inconsistencies  

### ✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Univariate analysis (distribution of numerical features)  
- Bivariate analysis (relationship between features & churn)  
- Churn rate comparison across customer segments  

### ✔️ Data Visualization
- Histograms, count plots, box plots  
- Churn vs Tenure  
- Churn vs Contract Type  
- Churn distribution by Payment Method
